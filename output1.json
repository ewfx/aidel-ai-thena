        ],
        "Confidence Score": 0.913,
        "Reason": "Both Google and Amazon have demonstrated strong compliance with international sanctions and regulatory standards. They have suspended services in high-risk regions, such as Russia, and maintain transparency in their operations. Their risk exposure is further minimized due to their proactive legal and cybersecurity measures, ensuring adherence to global financial and ethical norms. Despite strong compliance, both companies face regulatory scrutiny—Google for antitrust issues and Amazon for supply chain risks—along with exposure to shifting geopolitical policies. While highly regulated, Microsoft’s data privacy concerns and Wells Fargo’s history of financial scandals raise questions about internal controls and compliance robustness."

        "Reason": "Microsoft and Wells Fargo both operate under strict financial and cybersecurity regulations. Microsoft has a well-documented history of compliance with international sanctions, while Wells Fargo, as a major financial institution, is heavily regulated by U.S. and global financial authorities. Their established risk management frameworks, regulatory oversight, and commitment to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) practices contribute to their low-risk profile."
