## 🎯 Introduction
Entity verification and risk assessment in financial transactions are critical but highly manual and error-prone. This project aims to develop a Generative AI/ML-powered system to automate the research and evidence-gathering process by:
 *Extracting and enriching entity names from transaction data.
 *Verifying and classifying entities using public data sources (e.g., WikiData, SEC EDGAR, OFAC Sanctions list).
 *Detecting fraudulent or high-risk entities through anomaly detection.
 *Assigning risk scores and providing supporting evidence to assist analysts.

The solution will improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and enhance the accuracy of risk evaluation.
